# The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Job Market
## Description 
•	Analyzed the effects of AI adoption on job displacement trends across industries, identifying sectors at high risk of automation-driven job loss.
•	Researched emerging skills and competencies required in AI-driven roles and developed a competency framework to address workforce needs.
•	Explored societal challenges such as inequality and the digital divide caused by automation, providing actionable policy recommendations for workforce adaptation.
•	Conducted surveys, analyzed employment data, and reviewed case studies to support findings with industry-specific insights.

## Project Goal
This project investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the job market, focusing on:
1. **Job Displacement Trends**: Identifying industries most at risk of automation.
2. **Skill Evolution**: Understanding which competencies are becoming obsolete and which are emerging as vital.
3. **Policy Recommendations**: Providing actionable strategies to balance innovation with workforce sustainability.

The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for policymakers, educators, and businesses to navigate AI's workforce implications effectively.
